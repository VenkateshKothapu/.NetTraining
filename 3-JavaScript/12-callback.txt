callback functions-
----------------------

A callback is a function you call back after something is finished

functions can accept other functions as parameters.which are called callback functions
these callbacks runs when the mainfunction has finished,giving you the ability to manage how the program proceeds

example of callback-
------------------------
Imagine you are building a LEGO house üß±
When you're done building it, your mom says:

‚ÄúWhen you're done, call me, and I will take a photo of your house.‚Äù

This Is a Callback!-

You build the house ‚û°Ô∏è This is the main task (main function).

Your mom takes a photo ‚û°Ô∏è This is the callback (something to do after you're done).

simple code-

function buildHouse(afterBuilding) {
  console.log(" Building the house...");
  afterBuilding(); // Call the other thing after you're done
}

function takePhoto() {
  console.log(" Taking a photo of the house!");
}

buildHouse(takePhoto);
