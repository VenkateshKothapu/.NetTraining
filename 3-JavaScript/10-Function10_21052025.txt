Function-
-------------
 A function is a Block of code that performs a tasks .
 instead of repeating same code again and again, we put inside the function and call the function whenever needed



Named functions-
---------------

A named function is a function that has a name
 this is the syntax below for named function
    
              function functionname(){
               //code to run      
              }

example of named function-

              function greet(){
               console.log("hey how are you!")
              }

      function-keyword to define function
      greet   - Name of the function
      ()      - place to add inputs
      {}      - block that hold's the functions code



*how to call a function?
 we can call(invoke) a function by just write the function name with ()
                     greet();    // this runs the function


 *we can see one example as of now-

          function greet(){
             console.log("hey how are you");
          }
           greet();    //the output will be (hey how are you)


***shortcut key to comment and uncomment block of code is(ctrl + / )

now another example I tried for named function according to class 10-jsfile.

 function supercarsdetails(){
    let cardetails="";
    cardetails="venky likes:"+"Rangerover";
    console.log(cardetails);
    return cardetails;
   }
   supercarsdetails();    //output- venky likes:Rangerover

Anonymous function-
------------------

An Anonymous function is a function without a name.
we usually store it in a variable.


Syntax-
--------

let greet=function(){
console.log("hello anonymous function");
};

here function()-- No name after the function
greet  ---  is a variable that holds the function


*To call (invoke) it
greet(); // this prints: hello anonymous function



uses of anonymous function
--------------------------
 - They are useful for short tasks.
 - Reduces the need to define named functions.
 - common in event handling and callbacks.
 - Helps keep code clean and flexible. 


example of anonymous function-
------------------------------
 let greet=function(){
 console.log("hey how are you");
 };
 
 greet();   //output: hey how are you


now lets practise in vs code-
-----------------------------
*example-1

let cars=function(){
    console.log("venkatesh fav car is Rangerover");

};

cars();
 

*example2-

let add =function(a,b){
    console.log("sum is ",a+b);
};
add(5,6);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

*what is an IIFE ?
  
An IIFE is a function that runs immediately after it's defined . no need to call it later.
that's why it is called immediately invoked.

*Basic syntax for IIFE-

        
          (function(){
            console.log("hey how are you");
           })();

              //output:hey how are you               

-function() {.....} -- Anonymous function
-Wrapped inside ()  -- to make it an expression
-The last ()        -- invokes(calls) it immediately


why we use IIFE-
---------------
- To run code immediately.
- To protect variables from outside code.
- To organize your code into private blocks.
