TO Download files from GitHub repo to our local system 
 we need to pass certain commands

*This is the command used to clone the repo (git clone URL)
git clone https://github.com/madanpatakota/JS-Training.git

*Then after we can go into that folder by command cd
*Then we have to fetch all the files Git fetch -- all
*we can see the total master and branches there
*then we can checkout to particular branch we want by command (git checkout -b Madan_14052025)

*Then we have to connect our local repo to remote repo and pull the files
 the command to connect repo remote
          [git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/Madan_14052025]

*Now we can pull that files from that branch to our local machine by command

             [git pull]
*after this we can see the files in our system 

* in this way I downloaded madan anna repo manually by command prompt
